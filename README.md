# Microsoft Fabric & Databricks training for partners

Thanks for taking the time to learn more about Microsoft Fabric and Databricks! In this repo, you will find:

1. **fabricsetup.md** file, that will help you setting up the Fabric environment
2. **lab1_fabric.md** file, that will explain you how to access the first lab, which will be fully executed in Fabric
3. **lab3_part2.1_fabric.md** file, which will be the "continuation" of the lab 3 that you started on Databricks. **It is not necessary to have completed the databricks part to be able to complete this lab section**. Thus, feel free to start directly from here if you'd like.
